## Introduction

I use Vim as my main password manager instead of the popular 1Password. I [even wrote an article about it](https://medium.com/@djaiss/the-not-so-definitive-guide-to-migrate-from-1password-to-vim-to-manage-your-passwords-950c162b610f). Anyway. The only thing that I miss is a password generator. This is why I created this very simple online password generator.

## Technology

I use the awesome [Jen library](https://github.com/mykiimike/jen) to generate random passwords. On a sidenote, I'm the worst JS developer the world has ever known - so if you want to change the code and enhance it, it wil be very much appreciated.
